Tic-Tac-Toe-Puzzle
==================

A fun puzzle based around Tic-Tac-Toe

Found the following puzzle on a [blog](http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/test-your-intuition-17-what-does-it-take-to-win-tic-tac-toe/). The included code is a simple simulator I used to narrow down the answer. The problem is:

>Take a standard game of tic-tac-toe on a 3x3 square. Now suppose that the X player has a budget of Y dollars, the O playare has a budget of 100 dollars, and before each round the two players bid who makes the next move. The highest bidder makes the move and his budget is reduced by his bid. The other player does not move that round.
>
>For example, if, to start with, the X player has 120 dollars, and if for the first move X bids 40 dollars and O bids 30 dollars, then X will make the first move and will be left with 80 dollars while O will be left with his 100 dollars.
>
>What would you expect the minimal value of Y is so the X player is guaranteed to win? Of course if Y>300, X can make 3 uninterrupted moves and win, but perhaps much less is enough?

>Also note that on a tie, we flip a coin, meaning that X is not guaranteed a win in these situations.
